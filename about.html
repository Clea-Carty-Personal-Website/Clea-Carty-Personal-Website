          I work as an Independant Contractor with Doordash Food Delivery and
          Takeout Services. This service also provides grocery shopping and
          other pickup and drop services. Every now and then, I would get an
          order to pick up a few things from Dollar General or Carlie C's, a
          local grocery store in my town. <br />
          There are people in my community who have no form of transprtation
          readily available to them, so they turn to Doordash to help out in
          that area. I feel good knowing I am doing my part to help these people
          out in their time of need. Its especially rewarding when I deliver to
          an elderly person who seems to be living alone. They are more often
          than not regular users of the service and I have developed a rapport
          with them which they appreciate.

          American brain coach and podcaster Jim Kwik has a saying, "As your
          body moves, your brain grooves". I am a firm believer in this because
          I feel like my brain literally operates better when I work out. I've
          noticed that anytime I stop working out for a certain period of time,
          I start to feel sluggish and unmotivated. <br />
          My go to forms of excercise are Zumba and Cardio Kickboxing, which I
          do in my garage at home. I remember the moves of most of the songs
          from my days of going to zumba classes - Youtube is also an excellent
          resource for zumba-, and Ive even made up my own moves for a few
          songs. For cardio kickboxing I use a workout video on Amazon Prime.
          Every now and then I like to mix things up with a workout video on
          Youtube. There is even a Strong By Zumba video which packs in more
          intensity in only 20 minutes.

          Another way I spend my time is by cooking a good meal or baking some
          bread. This is a crucial way for me to avoid eating fast food. Not to
          say that I don't indulge - I do have my favorites. The important thing
          is that most of my meals are prepared at home, so that eating out is
          not a regular occurence. I also meal-prep once a week so that I don't
          have to cook or think about cooking especially on my work days. <br />
          When I get a chance to bake some bread my tried and true recipe is
          Simple Wheat Bread. I found it on allrecipes and I have never deviated
          from it because the taste is great and its perfect for making
          sandwiches. I think its the honey and butter that does the trick!
          Unlike the bread we buy from the store that stays on the counter, I
          slice my wheat bread and store it in the freezer so that it stays
          fresh. When someone wants a couple slices,they just have to thaw it in
          the microwave for about 10-15 seconds and its ready to go.
