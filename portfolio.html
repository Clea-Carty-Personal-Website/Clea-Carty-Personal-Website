          This QR code Componenent challenge project was courtesy of Frontend
          Mentor, a website that provides coding challenges for all developers
          at all skill levels, from newbie to advanced. <br />
          This particular challenge was to make a qr code which the user will
          scan to get access to the Frontend Mentor website and begin doing
          coding challenges!

          This project was another Frontend Mentor Challenge called Results
          Summary Component. It was a slight step up from the first challenge in
          the degree of complexity. There was a lot more elements needed to put
          this one together, but I really had fun working on it. I learned about
          the background-image:linear gradient styling property while working on
          this.It was an awesome challenge! <br />
          The purpose of this challenge was to create an interface that shows
          the user's scores in each category and then summarize those scores
          into one overall score.

          This project was a class assignment in which we had to create a zoo
          website to introduce new employees to the animals they would be taking
          care of. It gives details such as the animals' names, their diets, and
          some background information. <br />
          There is also a link which provides more information on each animal.
